# cithara-frontend
HTML, CSS, JavaScript Registration Form

# How I worked on this project 
My goal for this project was to create something most apps use but without any frameworks.
- I built this app using inspirations from dribble for the design 
- I also used regex and the local storage API for login verification

# How to navigate this project 

# If I had more time I would change this 
I would definitely work on the design more and also use regex to be able to check phone numbers and usernames as opposed to just using emails for logins.

# Available scripts
